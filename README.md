# Chatbot---Multilingual-Voice
Our project is revolutionizing the way people interact with AI by merging voice input and output with cutting-edge language models like ChatGPT. Traditionally, AI systems rely on text-based communication, but our solution takes it a step further by enabling users to speak directly to the system.
With just a simple microphone, users can ask questions and receive immediate voice responses, making information more accessible to everyone, especially those with visual impairments. This solution opens up new possibilities for the blind and visually impaired, allowing them to engage with AI effortlessly in their day-to-day lives.
Weâ€™re committed to improving accessibility and making technology more inclusive. By enhancing the interaction with voice-enabled AI, we aim to empower users by giving them the ability to communicate with AI in a natural and intuitive way.
Furthermore, our solution recognizes the importance of language as a bridge to accessibility. English, being a universal language, ensures global reach and usability, while Hindi, as our national language, allows us to connect deeply with the people of India. By supporting both, we are creating a system that is not only inclusive but also culturally relevant, ensuring that users from diverse backgrounds can leverage the power of AI seamlessly.
